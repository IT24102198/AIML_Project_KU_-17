# Mental Health in Tech Survey ‚Äì Data Preprocessing  

## üìå Overview of the Project  
This project focuses on **data preprocessing** of a survey dataset related to mental health in tech workplaces. The process involves several key steps to clean, standardize, and prepare the data for analysis or modeling.

## üìä Dataset Details  
- **Source File:** `survey.csv`  
- **Domain:** Mental health in the tech industry  
- **Final Dataset Shape:** **1219 rows √ó 51 columns**  
- Data is processed sequentially through multiple Jupyter notebooks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Code  

The preprocessing must be executed in the **following order**, as each step produces a new dataset for the next step:  

1. **Missing Data Handling**  
   - Notebook: `IT24_Missing_Data_Handling.ipynb`  
   - Input: `survey.csv`  
   - Output: `survey_cleaned.csv`  

2. **Gender Standardization**  
   - Notebook: `IT24_Gender_Standardizing.ipynb`  
   - Input: `survey_cleaned.csv`  
   - Output: `survey_cleaned_II.csv`  

3. **Outlier Removal**  
   - Notebook: `IT24_Outlier_Removal.ipynb`  
   - Input: `survey_cleaned_II.csv`  
   - Output: `survey_no_outliers.csv`  

4. **Normalization**  
   - Notebook: `IT24_Normalization.ipynb`  
   - Input: `survey_no_outliers.csv`  
   - Output: `survey_scaled.csv`  

5. **Encoding**  
   - Notebook: `IT24_Encoding.ipynb`  
   - Input: `survey_scaled.csv`  
   - Output: `survey_encoded.csv`  

6. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Notebook: `IT24100667_Feature_Engineering.ipynb`  
   - Input: `survey_encoded.csv`  
   - Output: `survey_final_features.csv`
